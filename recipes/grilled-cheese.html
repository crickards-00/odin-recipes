<p> Grilled cheese is one of North Americas simple and staple comfort
    food. It can be as simple as two slices of simple wonder bread
    and kraft singles or as elevated as fresh bakery sour dough and 
    severl differnt types of cheese all picked to add something different.
    Every has their own spin on this classic tasty sandwich, today I will
    be walking you through my own spin. I hope you enjoy is as much as I do.

</p>
<h3>Ingrediants</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Sour dough bread</li>
    <li>28g of sharp chedder</li>
    <li>28g of gruyer</li>
    <li>Mayonnaise</li>
</ul>

<ol>
    <li>We're gonna start by grating up the cheese, this helps its melt
        faster.</li>
        <li>Next, lets get a pan on the stove top and set the temp
            to low/medium heat</li>
        <li>Get the one peice of bread and spread mayo on one side,
            lay that side down on the pan and start laying on the cheese.
        </li>
        <li>Cover with a lid and let sit for a couple minutes, remove lid
            and add a second peice of mayo'd bread (mayo side up) on top 
            of the melting cheese and flip the grilled cheese. (if your not
            happy with the level of toastedness of the first peice of bread
            we can always flip it again later)
        </li>
        <li>Cover again for another couple of minutes. At this point your 
            grilled cheese should be all done. Remove and cut into whatever
            shape you want. ENJOY!
        </li>

        
</ol>
